      </p>
      <p>
        In the early 1990’s Mark undertook a personal project to document all
        the Civil War soldiers interred at Albany Rural Cemetery. It became his
        main hobby. In over 25 years of researching Civil War soldiers and
        sailors interred at Albany Rural Cemetery, Mark has uncovered numerous
        fascinating biographical stories of the men and women of the Civil War
        era, many of which he has authored as articles for the Cemetery
        newsletter. In addition, Mark has given presentations to countless
        historical organizations from Hadley-Luzerne to Gettysburg and has
        served as Master of Ceremonies for several Civil War gravestone
        dedication ceremonies.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark was the primary researcher for “People of Albany: The Civil War”
        (Peter J. Hess, 2008), and he was a contributor to the more recent book,
        “These Exalted Acres: Unlocking the Secrets of Albany Rural Cemetery”
        (Paul Grondahl, 2013). In 2004 Mark and four friends founded The Civil
        War Buffs history group, now in their 17th year.{" "}

        Kurt Swartz: AAS in Forestry, BS in Resources Management, MS in Forest
        Soil Science. He served a career of 34 years with the NYS Department of
        Environmental Conservation (DEC). IN 1989 he began to practice as a
        specialist in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), thereafter forming
        the GIS section of the Division of Lands and Forests, serving as it’s
        administrator until retirement in 2010. During this period, he directed
        the transformation of DEC’s forest records from paper maps, desktop
        databases and hand tally forest inventory practice into a system using
        geo-spatial data, a centralized Oracle RDBMS and GPS enabled field data
        recorders. Backed by an ongoing and comprehensive staff training
        program, forestry staff statewide benefited from advanced technology
        implementations, speeding work performance, and service ability. During
        this time, he oversaw the development of statewide recreation data on
        all DEC lands representing 12% of New York State’s surface area. These
        data were made available to the recreational public via a WEB based GIS
        mapping project titled the State Lands Interactive Mapper allowing the
        public to view, query and print custom recreation maps of all DEC lands.
        This mapper remains in operation today. As a licensed pilot he further
        utilized his knowledge in the capture of aerial photography for both
        natural resources and law enforcement clients. Aside from occupational
        service, he practiced EMS as a Paramedic, Critical Trauma Care
        instructor, and EMS lab instructor for HVCC’s Paramedic outreach
        program. He has been involved with the University at Albany since 2007,
        providing Undergraduate and Graduate level instruction in Geography and
        GIS in both introductory and advanced course offerings.

      <p>
        Alexander Buyantuev is an Associate Professor in the Department of
        Geography and Planning, University at Albany. He received his B.S. and
        M.S. (1988) in Geography from Irkutsk State University in Russia and
        M.S. (2002) in Natural Resources Management from the University of
        Arizona. He holds a Ph.D. in Geography (1993) from the Russian Academy
        of Sciences, and Ph.D. in Plant Biology (2008) from Arizona State
        University. During his earlier carrier he worked in the Institute of
        Geography in Irkutsk, Russia, and also taught courses in Cartography and
        GIS in Irkutsk State University. He is most interested in the
        interactions between spatial patterns and ecological processes on
        multiple spatial scales from the experimental plot to the regional
        landscape. Spatial patterns include fine- to broad-scale variations in
        climatic, soil, and other biophysical conditions as well as land use and
        land cover pattern in a geographic area. Specific ecological processes
        he has been studying include vegetation phenology and primary
        productivity. His research on urban ecosystem dynamics is directed
        towards understanding trajectories of land use and land cover in growing
        urban areas and the role of vegetation on urban microclimates and
        ecosystem services production. Dr. Buyantuev teaches introductory and
        advanced courses in physical geography, remote sensing, and landscape
        ecology. In his remote sensing lab, he currently uses unmanned aircrafts
        outfitted with a variety of advanced sensors to map spatial patterns of
        land cover in his field sites of interest.{" "}
